# Terminal-Based-Maze-Solver
develop a terminal-based application that generates a random maze, finds a path
from the start to the end, and visualizes the maze and path in the terminal.

<h1>Input:</h1>
1. Size of the maze ( ).

2. Users choose to either print the path, generate another puzzle, or exit the game.


<p>Output:</p>
1. A visual representation of the generated maze in the terminal.

2. A visual representation of the path from start to end, if it exists.
Rules:
1. The maze is represented as a array where each cell can be either a wall or
an open space.
2. The top-left corner is the start ( ) and the bottom-right corner is the end ( ).
3. The application should provide options to print the path, generate another
puzzle, or exit the game.
4. The number of random walls should be restricted to be less than or equal to
% of the total cells to increase the likelihood of a solvable maze.


<p>Guidelines:</p>
1. Generate a random maze of size with walls and open spaces.
2. Implement a pathfinding algorithm to find a path from the start to the end.
3. Visualize the maze and the path in the terminal.
4. Provide options to the user for further actions.
